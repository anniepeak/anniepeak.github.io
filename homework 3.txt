In the style.css file, I customized the website’s appearance to create a clean, professional, and visually appealing layout. First, I applied a global font style by setting the font-family to Arial, sans-serif for the entire website, ensuring readability and consistency across all pages. For the color scheme, I chose a dark background (#333) for the header and footer sections, contrasted with white text (#fff) to make the navigation and contact information stand out. The body background was set to a lighter color (#f4f4f4), making the content area easier to read. To further enhance the layout, I added custom padding and margins to the section and img elements, creating more space between the content and improving the flow of the page.
Additionally, I styled the navigation links in the header by displaying them inline and adding spacing between each link for better readability. The links were set to white to match the header's background, and their default underline was removed to create a cleaner look. For responsiveness, I included the meta viewport tag in the HTML, which ensures the website adjusts smoothly on mobile devices, allowing users to experience a well-structured layout regardless of screen size. The use of clear and contrasting colors, spacing adjustments, and responsive design elements provides a user-friendly experience with a polished appearance.
