        <h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>
        <p>I will be leaving a few facts below about the city of Boston, and some of my favorite spots in the city. </p>
        <h3>History of Boston</h3>
        <p>Boston, one of the oldest cities in the United States, has a rich and storied history that dates back to its 
          founding in 1630 by Puritan settlers. It became a key site for several events that shaped the nation's path toward 
          independence, earning its reputation as the "Cradle of Liberty." One of the most significant events in Boston's history 
          is the Boston Tea Party of 1773, where American colonists protested British taxation without representation by dumping 
          tea into Boston Harbor. This act of rebellion played a crucial role in igniting the American Revolution.
          During the Revolutionary War, Boston was also the site of the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775, a fierce confrontation between 
          British and American forces that demonstrated the colonists' determination to fight for their freedom. Following independence, 
          Boston continued to grow as a center for education, trade, and industry. Harvard University, founded in 1636, became a leading 
          institution, and the city emerged as a hub for intellectual and social movements. In the 19th century, Boston was a major player 
          in the abolitionist movement, with activists like William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass leading the charge against 
          slavery. The city also played a role in the rise of the labor movement and became a beacon for Irish immigrants during the Great 
          Famine, shaping its cultural landscape. Today, Boston remains a city steeped in history, with landmarks like the Freedom 
          Trail, which offers a walk through America’s revolutionary past.</p>
