        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Annie Peak, and I’m excited to welcome you to my personal website.
          I’m majoring in Data Science and International Affairs, and I am a second year.
          I am interested in all things government, and being able to use data within government
          to provide accurate facts for the general public. In the spring, I will be on my first co-op 
          at the attorney generals office, in their cyber crime department. I am excited to have both
          sides of my majors involved in my co-op. I am originally from Cape Cod, Massachusetts. I enjoy going to the beach
          with my family, as well as exploring the city of Boston, and getting to hang out with my friends, and getting to 
          find new resturants and coffee shops to work at. I have one dog and two cats at home, and I hope to one day have a cat
          here in Boston. For this site, I will be leaving some facts about the city of Boston, which I have
          called home for the past 2 years. I want to discuss a bit about the history of the city, which is so important to the 
          history of our country, as well as list some of my favorite places within Boston. I hope you enjoy my website, as I am very 
          excited to create it and have it be shown! </p>
        <p>Feel free to explore the other pages to learn more about Boston, 
          and how to get in touch!</p>
